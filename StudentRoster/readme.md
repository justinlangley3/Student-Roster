# Student Roster Project

This project is a mock-up of a text-based student roster for educational facilities.
It's sole purpose is to demonstrate object-oriented programming and manual memory management in C++.
There is no functionality beyond this, and all data is hard-coded into the program.

The main program entry is in the roster.cpp file.
